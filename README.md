## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Research Physiotherapist and Highly Specialised Physiotherapist in Neurosciences at University College London. I work alongside Dr Anna Sadnicka's team at the Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences and the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, focusing on the phenomenology of hyperkinetic movement disorders.

After graduating with a BSc in Physiotherapy from the University of Liverpool, I have built extensive experience across neurological healthcare settings, from community rehabilitation to specialist tertiary services at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.

Throughout my career, I have developed expertise in self-management and goal setting for patients with neurological conditions. I have furthered my research capabilities through the NIHR Integrated Clinical Academic Internship programme, where I developed a research proposal focusing on functional neurological disorder.
